## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Development Environment Setup

```bash
# Initial project setup
npx create-next-app@latest intakeflow --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app
cd intakeflow

# Install core dependencies
npm install prisma @prisma/client
npm install next-auth @auth/prisma-adapter
npm install @radix-ui/react-* lucide-react
npm install resend stripe @stripe/stripe-js
npm install bullmq ioredis
npm install handlebars puppeteer
npm install zod react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers

# Install dev dependencies
npm install -D @types/node tsx prisma-erd-generator
npm install -D jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
npm install -D playwright @playwright/test

# Initialize Prisma
npx prisma init
```

### Database Migration Strategy

```bash
# Development workflow
npx prisma db push          # Push schema changes to dev DB
npx prisma generate         # Generate Prisma client
npx prisma studio          # Open database browser

# Production workflow
npx prisma migrate dev      # Create migration files
npx prisma migrate deploy   # Deploy to production
```

### Testing Strategy

```typescript
// Testing pyramid approach
// 1. Unit Tests (70%) - Individual functions and components
// 2. Integration Tests (20%) - API endpoints and workflows
// 3. E2E Tests (10%) - Critical user journeys

// Example test structure
tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── lib/
│   └── utils/
├── integration/
│   ├── api/
│   └── workflows/
└── e2e/
    ├── onboarding.spec.ts
    ├── workflow-creation.spec.ts
    └── client-portal.spec.ts
```

### Deployment Strategy

```yaml
# GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline
name: Deploy to Production
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run test
      - run: npm run build

  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to VPS
        run: |
          ssh user@server 'cd /app && git pull && docker-compose up -d --build'
```

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team (Solo Developer)

**Time Allocation:**

- **Frontend Development**: 40% (UI/UX, React components, forms)
- **Backend Development**: 35% (APIs, workflows, integrations)
- **DevOps & Infrastructure**: 15% (deployment, monitoring, security)
- **Testing & QA**: 10% (unit tests, integration tests, bug fixes)

### Technology Stack Costs

**Monthly Costs (MVP → Production):**

- **Hosting**: $25 → $100 (VPS scaling)
- **Database**: $0 → $25 (managed MySQL)
- **Email Service**: $0 → $35 (Resend scaling)
- **File Storage**: $5 → $25 (AWS S3)
- **Monitoring**: $0 → $20 (error tracking, analytics)
- **Total**: $30 → $205/month

### Third-Party Service Limits

**Free Tier Limits:**

- **Resend**: 3,000 emails/month → $20/month for 100k
- **Stripe**: 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction
- **HelloSign**: 3 documents/month → $15/month for unlimited
- **AWS S3**: 5GB free → $0.023/GB thereafter

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Database Performance**: Implement proper indexing and query optimization from day one
2. **Email Deliverability**: Use reputable providers and implement proper authentication
3. **File Storage Costs**: Implement file compression and cleanup policies
4. **Third-Party Dependencies**: Have fallback providers for critical services

### Business Risks

1. **Feature Creep**: Stick to MVP scope, use feature flags for gradual rollout
2. **User Adoption**: Implement comprehensive onboarding and documentation
3. **Competition**: Focus on unique value proposition and rapid iteration
4. **Scalability**: Design for scale from the beginning, use cloud-native approaches

## Success Metrics & KPIs

- **Code Coverage**: >80% for critical paths
- **Build Time**: <5 minutes for full deployment
- **Page Load Speed**: <2 seconds for dashboard
- **API Response Time**: <200ms for 95th percentile

### Business Metrics

- **User Activation Rate**: 70% within 24 hours
- **Feature Adoption**: 60% of users create workflows
